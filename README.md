# Data Science Portfolio
 
This repository gathers side projects I worked on or currently working on. The goal of projects is to use my data science/machine learning skills to explore interesting things. For each project I write short summary. I mainly use Python in Jupyter Notebook. To see full analysis and code click on the projects headline.
