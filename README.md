# Data Science Portfolio
 
This repository gathers side projects I worked on or currently working on. The goal of projects is to use my data science/machine learning skills to explore interesting things. For each project I write short summary. I mainly use Python in Jupyter Notebook. To see full analysis and code click on the projects headline.

Enjoy reading and if you have some questions, you can contact with me through my [Linkedin profile.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztof-sulima/)
