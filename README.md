# Data Science Portfolio
 
This is a repository of the side projects I worked on or currently working on. The projects are either written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to use data science/statistical modelling techniques to find something that is interesting. For each project I write short summary. To see full analysis and code click on the projects headline.
